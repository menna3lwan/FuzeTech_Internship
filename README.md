## Introduction

This repository tracks my progress in learning Python, from basic syntax to advanced topics. Each day‚Äôs folder includes code, explanations, and any challenges encountered.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the date of each day‚Äôs work:

- `day-01/`: Day 1 of learning Python.
- `day-02/`: Day 2 of learning Python.
- `...`
- `day-nn/`: Day N of learning Python.

Each day‚Äôs folder contains:
- `README.md`: Summary of the day‚Äôs learning and challenges.
- Python scripts: Code worked on that day.

## Challenges

Each day‚Äôs folder includes a `README.md` file that outlines the challenge and provides a brief explanation of the solution. Here are some examples:

### Example Challenge

- **Challenge**: Handling exceptions in a web scraper.
- **Solution**: Using try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions gracefully.
  - **Code**

## Tips and Tricks

- **Use Virtual Environments**: Isolate your project dependencies using `venv`.
- **Write Readable Code**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines for code readability.
- **Practice Regularly**: Consistency is key in mastering any programming language.
- **Explore Libraries**: Python has a vast ecosystem of libraries; don‚Äôt hesitate to explore them.
